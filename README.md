# go-nix - Nix library for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/zombiezen.com/go/nix.svg)][reference docs]

*STATUS*: Experimental

This repository is a streamlined fork of [github.com/nix-community/go-nix][],
a library to interoperate with [Nix][].
I am currently working on upstreaming these changes.
Until then, I am making my development branch available as `zombiezen.com/go/nix`.
