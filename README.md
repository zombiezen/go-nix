# go-nix - Nix library for Go

*STATUS*: Experimental

This repository is a streamlined fork of [github.com/nix-community/go-nix][],
a library to interoperate with [Nix][].
I am currently working on upstreaming these changes.
Until then, I am making my development branch available as `zombiezen.com/go/nix`.

[Nix]: https://nixos.org/
[github.com/nix-community/go-nix]: https://github.com/nix-community/go-nix
